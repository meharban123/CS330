## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By utlizing OOP concepts such as inheritance and abstraction we are able to create code that is secure and functional. For example by using abstraction we can separate private attributes from public and ensure that only the developers are able to access certain sensitive compononents of the codebase, thereby ensuring the security of that code. We can also use things like inheritance to reuse code and improve readability and have a higher degree of consistency and funtionality. Furthermore testing can be used to make sure that these concepts are utilized efficiently and in an effective manner.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

By first assessing the users needs and creating test cases based on those needs we can successfully create an environment in which we can meet the users demands. First we need to accurately be able to convert the users desires into a working document that we can then use to develop test cases to see how well our code meets their demands.

## How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software in a two fold manner. First I try to find all the requirements that my project needs and try to build a series of goals that need to be accomplished in order for the software to function properly and meet all the requirements. After that I use trial and error to try and meet all of those requirements as best as I can. The trial and error approach works best for me since it incorporates feedback into the testing process akin to something like Agile and I feel that this continuos cycle of feedback and improvement makes my code run better in the long run.
